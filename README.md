# WCAG Reporter

This repository lets you create WCAG EM Reports using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). 

* Write issues as Markdown files
* Create reports in English, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish or German
* Automatically output a score card in the report 
* Include your boilerplate easily, so that you can focus on describing issues

Eleventy is a static site generator. In this project we use it to combine all Markdown files into one HTML file that is a report.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/hidde/eleventy-wcag-reporter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=i18n&template=add-language-support.md&title=Add+translation%3A+%5Blanguage%5D) (to indicate you'd like to take this on; the template has some instructions) and file a Pull Request.


## Set up

1. On the command line, install [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) globally with `npm install -g @11ty/eleventy`
3. Get the project files; best [fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo), then [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) your copy. 
4. When the project files are on your computer, go to folder that contains the project files
5. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies this project needs.
6. Run `npm run dev` or `eleventy --serve` to start a local server and look at the reports
7. Customise the reports: add your own logo, colors, typography and content. There is [cipsum](https://cipsum.com/) everywhere.
8. [Create a new report](#create-a-report)

From now on, you'll onlly need to run that last step: `npm run dev` or `eleventy --serve`.

## Create a report

### Use the npm script

You can run `npm run add-report`, which will ask for a name and duplicate the example folder with that name.

### Manually 

1. Copy the demo folder and give it a unique name (for instance: “mysite”)
2. Add “mysite” into `reports.json`. This will tell 11ty to group its issues.
3. Provide meta data in `mysite/index.njk`

## Add issues 

1. Add issues as Markdown files the report's folder
2. Add metadata as YAML frontmatter

### Metadata

Issues accept some meta data to help create the report:

| Key     | Example | Description |
|------|----------|------|
| sc | 2.4.7 | The Success Criterion the issue falls under, numbers only, separated by dots or `none` to render as tip |
| severity | Low, Medium, High | Group issues by severity (these are just strings, use what works for you or your client) |
| difficulty | Low, Medium, High | Group issues by difficulty |
| title | Focus style missing | Name for the issue |
| sample | homepage |  Refer issue back to sample ID, or `all` if not related to specific example |

## View your reports

1. After initial [setup](https://github.com/hidde/eleventy-wcag-reporter#set-up), run `eleventy --serve` to start a server, this should show you links to all your reports

## Tweak the report to your liking

This tool is meant to help generate WCAG EM reports effectively. Nothing is set in stone, you can change it to your liking.

This section explains where things live.

| Component            | Explanation  | Where to change  |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| About this report    | Explains to reader how the report was created, how to interpret, etc | `src/_shared-content/[language]/about-this-report.md` | 
| Executive summary |  High level summary of results  | `summary.md` in the root of the report's folder |
| Report template | Blueprint for the report, decides order, etc | `src/_layouts/report.njk` |
| Surrounding HTML | `head`, etc | `src/_layouts/base.njk` |
| Translations | Strings in multiple languages, used in the templates | `src/_data/translations.json` |
| Styles for the report itself | | `src/_assets/report.css` |
| Scope, baseline, evaluators etc | Meta information displayed in the report | `src/reports/[your-report]/index.njk` |
| Language | Language for the report, also used for pulling in the correct translations and explanations | `src/reports/[your-report]/index.njk` |

## Filters and shortcodes

There are a couple of reporting-related filters available.

### Filter: link to success criterion

Creates a link to a success criterion in the [WCAG QuickRef](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.1), based on a WCAG SC number.

The mapping from number (e.g. `1.1.1`) to slug (e.g. `non-text-content`) is done in `.src/data/sc_to_slug.json`.

For instance: 

```
{% 1.1.1 | sc_uri(targetWcagVersion, language) %}
```

where: 

* `language` is the page's language (required) 
* `targetWcagVersion` is the WCAG version you're evaluating against, for example `2.1` or `"2.0"` (required)


displays: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=248#non-text-content

This can be used in a link, like so:

```
<a href="{% 1.1.1 | sc_uri(targetWcagVersion, language) %}">1.1.1</a>
```

And this content can be variable. If the SC number is in a variable called `sc`, this is how to link:

```
<a href="{% sc | sc_uri(targetWcagVersion, language) %}">{{ sc }}</a>
```


### Shortcode: results table

A table of results can be generated like this: 

``` 
{% sc_table issueList, language, targetLevel %}
```

where:

* `issueList` is an object with all issues for this report (assumes each issue has `sc` in front matter with a number, like `1.1.1`) (required)
* `language` is the page's language (required) 
* `targetLevel` is the evaluation target, one of these options: `A`, `AA` or `AAA` (required)
* `targetWcagVersion` is the WCAG version you're evaluating against, for example: `2.1` (required)

### Shortcode: sample image

With the `sample_image` shortcode, you can output the URL of a screenshot for a sample.

``` 
{% sample_image id, reportName %}
```

You'll need to add the id of the sample (e.g. `sample-1`) and the folder name of the report (e.g. `example`). 

This will then output either `images/sample-1.png` (if it exists) or the URL to a default image.

The default can be changed by updating `.src/reports/example/images/default-screenshot.png`.
